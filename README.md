# Kolkata Metro Guide

Welcome to the **Kolkata Metro Guide** project! This repository provides a graphical guide and helpful resources for navigating the Kolkata Metro system, including route details, line connections, and visual representations of station locations and routes.

---

## Features

- **Graphical Map**: A visual representation of the Kolkata Metro lines, including Green, Blue, Purple, Orange, and extended lines.
- **Station Details**: Important station information, including interchanges and line colors.
- **Route Information**: Display connections between stations and suggest efficient paths for travelers.

## Project Structure

- `src/` — Contains the main code for the metro guide.
- `data/` — Data files for metro lines, stations, and routes.
- `visuals/` — Graphical representations and map images.
- `README.md` — This README file.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python** — For data processing and visualization.
- **NetworkX** — For building and visualizing the metro graph network.
- **Matplotlib** — For plotting the graphical metro map.
- **Git** — For version control.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kolkata-metro-guide.git
   cd kolkata-metro-guide
2. **Install required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the script**
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Usage

1. **Navigating the Map**:
   - The generated map includes major metro lines in Kolkata with station details and line colors.
   - Interchange stations like Esplanade and Park Street are marked for easier navigation.
2. **Route Guide**:
   - Users can plan routes by observing line changes and following station-to-station paths.
  
## Future Plans
  - Shortest Path Finder: Add a route-finding algorithm to suggest the shortest or most efficient path using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
  - Real-time Data: Integrate real-time metro timings and alerts.
